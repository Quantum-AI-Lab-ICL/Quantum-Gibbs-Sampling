# Quantum-Gibbs-Sampling
This repository contains the code for exact numerical simulations of fermionic quantum Gibbs sampling from the paper *Polynomial Time Quantum Gibbs Sampling for Fermi-Hubbard model at any Temperature*; authored by Štěpán Šmíd, Richard Meister, Mario Berta, and Roberto Bondesan, and available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01412.

The structure of the Python code is very simple, and it only needs numpy, scipy, and openfermion to run. The `main()` function in `gibbs_sampler.py` has all the parameters of a calculation that can be adjusted at the top.
